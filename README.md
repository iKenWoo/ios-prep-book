##### Where to Get Help
If you don't understand or get stuck on something, as a registered Lighthouse Labs student you have (or will soon receive) access to our private [iOS Prep Discussion Forum](http://ios-prep.lighthouselabs.ca/login). Please contact the admissions person you are in contact with if you feel you should have access but have not received it yet.

This private discussion forum exists solely for students who are preparing for the bootcamp program to get help from instructors, mentors and each other on the prep course. You can submit your question as a new Topic (one problem per topic please; feel free to create multiple topics if you are stuck in multiple places). You will get an e-mail notification for every reply to your topic.

You are encouraged to discuss your progress and challenges on the forum. The more you do this, the better prepared you'll be for class. In fact, see if you can help others by tackling their unanswered questions.


#### When to Ask for Help
Basically, If you don't understand or get stuck on something. You are expected to work through the questions and assignments to the best of your ability. However, we are here to help and make sure you spend your time effectively.

As a general rule of thumb, **if you are stuck on something for more than 30 min** you should go to the forum for help. Chances are somebody else is stuck, or has been stuck in the same spot.

#### Required Laptop Specs
We require you to bring either a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, running the most current Mac OS X. Laptops should be no more than 3 years old with a minimum of 4 GB of RAM. Monitor size is less important because we do have some external monitors on-site, but 13 inches is as small as you should go.
